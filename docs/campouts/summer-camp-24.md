## Weather

Rain was often forcasted, but it never came.\
Sunday, Monday, Tuesday were hot! Temperatures around 95 degrees.\
Wednesday, Thursday, and Friday weather was nicer around 85 degrees with some clouds.\

We setup a misting system to help with the heat. We do this every year.\
The pressure regulator or the nozzles may shoot right out of the line from too much pressure.\
