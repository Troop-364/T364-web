## Weather

Rain was often forcasted, but it never came.\
Sunday, Monday, Tuesday were hot! Temperatures around 95 degrees.\
Wednesday, Thursday, and Friday weather was nicer around 85 degrees with some clouds.\

We setup a misting system to help with the heat. We do this every year.\
The pressure regulator or the nozzles may shoot right out of the line from too much pressure.\

## Lessons Learned 

- Adding an extra water pressure regulator to a water spigot (without a hose) prevents water from splattering all over the place. (We had a 4 line splitter this year. Thanks Billy.)
- Do more bench work before we go to summer camp. This year everyone was busy and it was hot.
- On the bench lettering, the paint bleed through the stencis and stuck when they dried. Using a marker to trace the letters then paint after removing the stencils.
- The bat house wood could have been thinner. We only need half inch wood.

## Random

For IOLS Training we made dutch oven no-kneed bread.

- 1 1/2 cups warm water
- 1 packet yeast
- 1/2 tablespoon salt
- 3 1/4 cups flour
- parchment paper

Mix in a bowl. Place dough ball in a different bowl lined with parchment paper and let rise for 1 to 3 hours depending on temperature outside. When it doubles in size it is ready.\
Preheat dutch oven to 400 degrees\
Cook for about 30 minutes.
